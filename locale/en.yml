escootie.intro: Tina, an electric scooter rider, had an idea to create an app for fellow riders to choose optimal well-maintained paths for their ride, so she made up eScootie. We had meaningful conversations to pick up the most important aspects of the product and craft attractive brand identity from that. We both enjoyed the cooperation so we agreed to continue together on the next projects.

timemo.intro: Timemo is an app for writing memos to the future yourself. I took on the challenge of creating a whole visual identity for the project. The result is fresh and attractive and different from the similar apps. There you can write stories, so there is a strong backstory behind Timemo itself. Currently, we’re collaborating on optimising the UX/UI to make the product better and easier to use.
